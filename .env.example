# ==================================
# Electric Shop - Microservices Platform
# ==================================
#
# This is the root .env.example file for the Electric Shop project.
# Each microservice has its own .env file for environment-specific configuration.
#
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT create a .env file in this directory.
# Instead, copy the .env.example file from each microservice directory.
#
# ==================================
# Environment Files Location
# ==================================
#
# User Service (Authentication & User Management):
#   - Template: ./user_service/.env.example
#   - Create:   ./user_service/.env
#
# Future Microservices:
#   - Product Service:       ./product_service/.env
#   - Order Service:         ./order_service/.env
#   - Payment Service:       ./payment_service/.env
#   - Notification Service:  ./notification_service/.env
#   - Inventory Service:     ./inventory_service/.env
#
# ==================================
# Quick Start
# ==================================
#
# 1. Navigate to the microservice directory:
#    cd user_service
#
# 2. Copy the example environment file:
#    cp .env.example .env
#
# 3. Edit the .env file with your configuration:
#    nano .env  (or use your preferred editor)
#
# 4. Start the infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis):
#    cd ..
#    docker-compose up -d
#
# 5. Run the microservice:
#    cd user_service
#    ./gradlew bootRun
#
# ==================================
# Shared Infrastructure
# ==================================
#
# The docker-compose.yml in this directory provides shared infrastructure:
# - PostgreSQL (port 5433)
# - Redis (port 6379)
#
# All microservices can connect to these shared services.
